"The translations of SpotMachine are handled through the Translation Project"
"\\footnote{\\url{http://translationproject.org}}, where a lot of very "
"experienced language teams do the actual translations and handle submission "
"of these translations back to projects like SpotMachine. Therefore, if you "
"want to contribute, you should contact the language team for your language. "
"Usually, these teams are even able to proofread your translation. There is a "
"list of all language teams at the Translation Project's website, complete "
"with contact information."

"Translating SpotMachine into your language (or improving on an existing "
"translation) requires no programming skills at all. All the application's "
"text strings and their translated counterparts are stored in a text file in "
"a certain format, one file per language. Several text editors exist that are "
"able to edit these so-called PO files in a very user friendly manner. Two "
"recommended PO editors are Lokalize\\footnote{\\url{http://userbase.kde.org/"
"Lokalize}} and Poedit\\footnote{\\url{http://www.poedit.net/}}."
