Handling translations
=====================

Before being able to add a new translation language or update an existing one,
you need to extract the translation keys from the source files. First, make sure
you have the newest source files from git. Then, cd to the project base dir (below
the src dir), and perform the following command:

xgettext -ktrc:1c,2 -ktnrc:1c,2,3 -ktr -kmarktr -ktrn:1,2 --from-code UTF-8 -o src/po/keys.pot $(find . -name "*.java")

If your language is missing, you can copy the keys.pot file to a new file named
after the ISO language code of your language, e.g.:
cp src/po/keys.pot src/po/de.po
(change "de" into your language code)

If your language file is there, and you want to update it, run the following
command in order to merge the updated keys into it, e.g.:
msgmerge -U src/po/de.po src/po/keys.pot
(change "de" into your language code)

Now, you're ready to do some translation work. A po-editor like lokalize or
poEdit is highly recommended for this.

If you forked the SpotMachine github repo, push your changes to your fork and
issue a pull request. This is the preferred method of submitting a translation.
However, if you're not very keen on git, you're welcome to submit your
translation through SpotMachine's issue tracker.
