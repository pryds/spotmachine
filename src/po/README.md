Translating SpotMachine
=======================

Translations of SpotMachine is handled by The Translation Project. Download the PO file of
your language from [SpotMachine's TranslationProject page](http://translationproject.org/domain/spotmachine.html)
and edit it with your favourite PO editor, such as [lokalize](http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize)
or [poedit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/). When you're done, the file needs
to be sent to the [Translation Project robot](http://translationproject.org/html/robot.html).

Beware that your language might already have a language team, and if so, you should
coordinate your efforts with them. The Translation Project [has a list](http://translationproject.org/team/index.html)
of translation teams, complete with contact info.
