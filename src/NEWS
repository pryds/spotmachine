Changes between 0.3.2 and 0.3.1
===============================

Major:
- Script for deb binary packaging added which means releases will now be accompanied by
  a deb file for easy installing on Debian/Ubuntu systems.

Minor:
- Fixed bug that caused incorrect text to show in tool tip at copy and remove buttons for
  scheduled spots.

Changes between 0.3 and 0.3.1
=============================

Minor:
- Output and recording mixers can be forced through the Java prefs file for SpotMachine.
  If a key called ForcePlayOnMixerNumber contains a value > 0 representing a valid mixer number,
  that mixer will be used (if applicaple)for playing spots instead of the default one.
  The same goes for recording spots, except here the key is called ForceRecordingOnMixerNumber.

Changes between 0.2 and 0.3
===========================

Major:
- Scheduled spots, in addition to spots played by interval (which is their new name,
  in stead of just "active" spots).
- NSIS script added, for compiling Windows installer (and uninstaller)

Minor:
- Long output lines are now automatically wrapped, so no need to put line ends in
  translation files, other than forced ones.
- Locale selection list (in preferences window) now doesn't contain "system default"
  setting. If the user hasn't chosen a locale before, the system default will still
  be used (if supported, otherwise English). Should make things less confusing for
  users (only real options to choose from), and we don't have to keep two translation
  files with the same content (English and program default, which is also English).
- Some Javadoc documentation added to class Util.

Changes between 0.1.1 and 0.2
=============================

Major:
- Preferences window
- Internationalisation,
     default language: System default, if applicable, otherwise English,
     additional language: Danish
- Normalization of newly recorded spots: DC offset removal, fade-in/out, volume

Minor:
- Now recording in mono instead of stereo.
- When removing the last active spot, pause is set on (if not already on)
- INSTALL file now explains how to make an executable file to start the program on Linux


Changes between 0.1 and 0.1.1
=============================

Major:
- Missing sound file doesn't cause crash on program start anymore. Now, the spot in question
  is just ignored instead.

Minor:
- "About" info window added.
- Not possible anymore to remove a spot while play loop is active.
- Code-related: centralized handling of stdout and stderr, including levels of debug info.
