Changes between 0.1 and 0.1.1
=============================

Major:
- Missing sound file doesn't cause crash on program start anymore. Now, the spot in question
  is just ignored instead.

Minor:
- "About" info window added.
- Not possible anymore to remove a spot while play loop is active.
- Code-related: centralized handling of stdout and stderr, including levels of debug info.
