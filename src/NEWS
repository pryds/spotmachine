Changes between 0.2 and 0.3
===========================

Major:
- Scheduled spots, in addition to spots played by interval (which is their new name,
  in stead of just "active" spots).
- NSIS script added, for compiling Windows installer (and uninstaller)

Minor:
- Long output lines are now automatically wrapped, so no need to put line ends in
  translation files, other than forced ones.

Changes between 0.1.1 and 0.2
=============================

Major:
- Preferences window
- Internationalisation,
     default language: System default, if applicable, otherwise English,
     additional language: Danish
- Normalization of newly recorded spots: DC offset removal, fade-in/out, volume

Minor:
- Now recording in mono instead of stereo.
- When removing the last active spot, pause is set on (if not already on)
- INSTALL file now explains how to make an executable file to start the program on Linux


Changes between 0.1 and 0.1.1
=============================

Major:
- Missing sound file doesn't cause crash on program start anymore. Now, the spot in question
  is just ignored instead.

Minor:
- "About" info window added.
- Not possible anymore to remove a spot while play loop is active.
- Code-related: centralized handling of stdout and stderr, including levels of debug info.
