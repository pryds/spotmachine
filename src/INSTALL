QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPOTMACHINE
===============================================

This program is distritbuted with an installer for Windows and .deb package
for Ubuntu and other Debian based systems. If you wish to install manually,
here is a brief guide to installing, which should work on both Linux,
Windows, and probably other systems.

1. Make sure your system has the Java JRE or JDK installed. If not, get and
   install the latest Java JRE from java.oracle.com or through your system's
   software management facility. Alternatives to the official Java, such as
   OpenJRE should also work just fine.
2. If you downloaded the binary package (filename ends in "bin"), you can
   jump to the next step. On the other hand, if you downloaded the source
   package (filename ends in "src"), you need the JDK above (JRE is not
   enough), and you need to compile the program. To do this on a Linux system,
   open a command line prompt, navigate to the src directory, and execute the
   following command:
   ./build.sh
   (You may need to run 'chmod 755 build.sh' on it first)
   A build script is not supplied for other systems like Windows and Mac, but
   if you know how to make one, you're very welcome to contribute it. If not,
   you're probably much better off by getting the pre-compiled "bin" package.
3. Copy or move the "bin" directory and all its files and subdirectories to a
   suitable place on your system, either in your home directory (for one-user
   installation) or somewhere in the main directory tree (for all-users
   installation). On Windows systems, this would probably be under
   C:\Program Files\ or similar. On Linux systems this would probably be
   under /opt
4. To start the program, execute the following command:
   ./spotmachine
5. On Linux, you can (alternatively to step 4) copy the spotmachine executable
   shell script file mentioned in step 4 to e.g. /usr/bin.
   Only, you need to load the file in a text editor and change the classpath
   part from relative paths to absolute paths. This means, if you copied
   SpotMachine to /opt/spotmachine-0.1.1, you need to change the "../bin" part
   into "/opt/spotmachine-0.1.1/bin" and the "resources/gettext-commons-0.9.6.jar"
   part into "/opt/spotmachine-0.1.1/bin/resources/gettext-commons-0.9.6.jar".
   This enables you to start the program just by typing spotmachine in any
   command prompt, or to create a menu item.


MAKING A BACKUP OF PROGRAM DATA AND SETTINGS
============================================

The program keeps its data (e.g. audio files) and user settings in two
different directories. If you copy these to e.g. a USB stick, you will be able
to keep everything during system re-installations, or to transfer everything
to another computer.

PROGRAM DATA: The program creates a direcory called .spotmachine (note the
period). If you use a Windows system, it will try to create this directory in
the Application Data directory. If this fails, or if you use any other system,
the directory will be created in the current user's home directory. On Linux/UNIX
systems, the directory will be a hidden one.

PROGRAM SETTINGS: Under Linux, a hidden .java directory is placed in your home
directory. In here, another hidden directory called .userPrefs exists, and here
a directory called SpotMachine will appear the first time you start the program
and change any setting.
