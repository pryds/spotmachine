# This list contains a list of supported locales, one locale per line.
# The first locale in the list will be the default for systems
# set to a non-supported locale.
# For each locale listed here, there will have to be a corresponding
# file called strings_ll_CC.properties, where ll_CC is the locale code
# listed below, containing translations to all strings used in the
# program.
# Lines starting with a # will be disregarded.
