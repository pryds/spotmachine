SpotMachine
===========

A program to record and sequentially play audio spots in e.g. supermarkets.

SpotMachine is an all-in-one program that aims to handle all aspects of audio
spot management, in supermarkets, malls, and other places where you want to play
repetitive, timed audio messages (commercials, public notices, etc.) to an
audience.

With SpotMachine you can record spots of your own though your computer's
microphone. The very easy-to-use graphical user interface makes it straight-forward
to handle these spots, and arrange them into a timed playlist.
